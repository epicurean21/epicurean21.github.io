  I am a backend developer with 3 years of experience in designing and implementing large-scale distributed systems, primarily using Java and Spring. 
  
  Currently, I work on the advertising system development team at LINE, the leading messenger app in Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand, where we handle billions of data points daily. I have a deep interest in the advertising domain and continuously strive to design system architectures that provide the best user experience.

  I am always on the lookout for better solutions and contribute to enhancing the performance and stability of the advertising platform. With this experience, I am committed to developing innovative, user-centric systems in the future.
